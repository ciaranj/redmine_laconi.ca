== laconi.ca plugin

This plugin is intended to provide basic integration with laconi.ca

Updates to various aspects of redmine will result in status changes in a laconi.ca server.

== Configuration
Pop along to the 'Plugins' section of the Administration page, select 'Configuration'.  
On this page fill out the details of the url to the OMB you're using and the username + password of the user you
want the redmine instance to act as.

Current proof-of-concept just sends a micro blog whenever an issue is saved, currently this message is a static method along the lines of:

@<login name of user who updated issue> just updated issue #<issue number>

However, surprisingly this was a doddle.... stay tuned.

== Server Urls
The given server url should be the full path to the application, for example: 
* http://twitter.com
* http://identi.ca
* http://some_host/blog/index.php  (Possible laconi.ca installation path)
